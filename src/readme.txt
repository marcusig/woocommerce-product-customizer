Allow your customers to create configurable products with a live preview of the result. Works using a system of layers.

== Description ==

The Product Configurator for WooCommerce allows you to use layers to produce instant visuals for your customers.

Give your customers a great experience, and make your life easy: no need to create many product variations with their images. 

Instead, export your layers from Photoshop, a 3D render, or any other source, and allow the user to configure their product using those.

Easily add a product configurator to WordPress, with the plugin Product Configurator for Woo!

* Multiple views: Display the different parts of your products using the multiple views feature
* Multiple steps: Selling complex products? Split your configurator in different steps to make the process easier to understand for your customers.
* Price per option: Charge an additional price for each option that requires it (requires an add-on).
* Form fields: Let your user input data such as text or numbers, as well as send files with their configuration (requires an add-on).
* Calculate complex prices with custom formulas (requires Extra-price and Form fields add-ons)
